# Guns, Germs and Steel
Implements a small model inspired by the book Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared
Diamond that describes why different peoples developed differently on a large
time scale (roughly the last 13000 years). Diamond only relies on environmental
arguments. This model focuses on the arguments of continent size and major
continental axes.
